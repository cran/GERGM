\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object that specifies the relationship between
statistics and the observed network. Currently, the following statistics can be
specified: c("out2star", "in2star",     "ctriads", "recip", "ttriads",
"edgeweigt").}

\item{covariate_data}{A data frame containing node level covariates the user
wished to transform into sender or reciever effects. It must have row names
that match every entry in colnames(raw_network), should have descriptive
column names.  If left NULL, then no sender or reciever effects will be
added.}

\item{normalization_type}{If only a raw_network is provided then, the function
will automatically check to determine if all edges fall in the [0,1] interval.
If edges are determined to fall outside of this interval, then a trasformation
onto the interval may be specified. If "division" is selected, then the data
will have a value added to them such that the minimum value is atleast zero
(if necessary) and then all edge values will be divided by the maximum to
ensure that the maximum value is in [0,1]. If "log" is selected, then the data
will have a value added to them such that the minimum value is atleast zero
(if necessary), then 1 will be added to all edge values before they are logged
and then divided by the largest value, again ensuring that the resulting
network is on [0,1]. Defaults to "log" and need not be set to NULL if
providing covariates as it will be ignored.}

\item{network_is_directed}{Logical specifying whether or not the observed
network is directed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{use_MPLE_only}{Logical specifying whether or not only the maximum pseudo
likelihood estimates should be obtained. In this case, no simulations will be
performed. Default is FALSE.}

\item{transformation_type}{Specifies how covariates are transformed onto the
raw network. When working with heavly tailed data that are not strictly
positive, select "Cauchy" to transform the data using a Cauchy distribution.
If data are strictly positive and heavy tailed (such as financial data) it is
suggested the user select "LogCauchy" to perform a Log-Cauchy transformation
of the data. For a tranformation of the data using a Gaussian distribution,
select "Gaussian" and for strictly positive raw networks, select "LogNormal".
The Default value is "Cauchy".}

\item{estimation_method}{Simulation method for MCMC estimation. Default is
"Gibbs" which will generally be faster with well behaved networks but will not
allow for exponential downweighting.}

\item{maximum_number_of_lambda_updates}{Maximum number of iterations of outer
MCMC loop which alternately estimates transform parameters and ERGM
parameters. In the case that data_transformation = NULL, this argument is
ignored. Default is 10.}

\item{maximum_number_of_theta_updates}{Maximum number of iterations within the
MCMC inner loop which estimates the ERGM parameters. Default is 100.}

\item{number_of_networks_to_simulate}{Number of simulations generated for
estimation via MCMC. Default is 500.}

\item{thin}{The proportion of samples that are kept from each simulation. For
example, thin = 1/200 will keep every 200th network in the overall simulated
sample. Default is 1.}

\item{proposal_variance}{The variance specified for the Metropolis Hastings
simulation method. This parameter is inversely proportional to the average
acceptance rate of the M-H sampler and should be adjusted so that the average
acceptance rate is approximately 0.25. Default is 0.1.}

\item{downweight_statistics_together}{Logical specifying whether or not the
weights should be applied inside or outside the sum. Default is TRUE and user
should not select FALSE under normal circumstances.}

\item{MCMC_burnin}{Number of samples from the MCMC simulation procedure that will be discarded before drawing the samples used for estimation. Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{Seed used for reproducibility. Default is 123.}

\item{convergence_tolerance}{Threshold designated for stopping criterion. If
the difference of parameter estimates from one iteration to the next all have
a p -value (under a paired t-test) greater than this value, the parameter
estimates are declared to have converged. Default is 0.01.}

\item{MPLE_gain_factor}{Multiplicative constant between 0 and 1 that controls
how far away the initial theta estimates will be from the standard MPLEs via a one step Fisher update. In the case of strongly dependent data, it is suggested
to use a value of 0.10. Default is 0.}

\item{acceptable_fit_p_value_threshold}{A p-value threshold for how closely
statistics of observed network conform to statistics of networks simulated
from GERGM parameterized by converged final parameter estimates. Default value
is 0.05.}

\item{force_x_theta_updates}{Defaults to 1 where theta estimation is not
allowed to converge until thetas have updated for x iterations . Useful when
model is not degenerate but simulated statistics do not match observed network
well when algorithm stops after first x updates.}

\item{output_directory}{The directory where you would like output generated
by the GERGM estimation proceedure to be saved (if output_name is specified).
This includes, GOF, trace, and parameter estimate plots, as well as a summary
of the estimation proceedure and an .Rdata file containing the GERGM object
returned by this function. May be left as NULL if the user would prefer all
plots be printed to the graphics device.}

\item{output_name}{The common name stem you would like to assign to all
objects output by the gergm function. Default value of NULL will not save any
output directly to .pdf files, it will be printed to the console instead. Must
be a character string or NULL. For example, if "Test" is supplied as the
output_name, then 4 files will be output: "Test_GOF.pdf", "Test_Parameter_Estim
ates.pdf", "Test_GERGM_Object.Rdata", "Test_Estimation_Log.txt", and
"Test_Trace_Plot.pdf"}

\item{generate_plots}{Defaults to TRUE, if FALSE, then no diagnostic or
parameter plots are generated.}
